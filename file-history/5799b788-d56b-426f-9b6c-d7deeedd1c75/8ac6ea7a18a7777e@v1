# CLI Chat Client

## Repository Context

FYI, this chat client is a separate application in a subdirectory of the
chat_service git repository. The subdirectory is called `cli_client`, and that
is the directory in which _this_ specific CLAUDE.md file is located. It is
important that you understand the difference between the git repository root
and the root of this chat client application.
