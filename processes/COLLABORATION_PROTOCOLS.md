# Collaboration Protocols

## Core Principle

**ALL creative and decision work happens collaboratively in the main conversation with active user participation.**

Agents serve as advisory/research support only, returning recommendations rather than finished artifacts. The user is not a rubber-stamp committee approving autonomous work—they are an active collaborator in design, architecture, and implementation.

## The Pair-Programming Model

### Traditional (Wrong) Flow
```
User: "Implement feature X"
Main: *launches agent*
[Agent works in isolation]
Agent: *returns finished implementation*
User: [approve/reject] ← Rubber stamp
```

### Collaboration-First (Correct) Flow
```
User: "Implement feature X"
Main: *launches advisory agent to research*
Agent: *explores, analyzes, stores findings in memento*
Agent: *returns recommendations with rationale*
Main: "Based on research, we could approach this as Y. What do you think?"
User: "Actually, let's adjust Z..."
Main: *proposes code/documentation*
User: *modifies proposal in IDE, adds QUESTION: comments*
Main: *sees modifications, acknowledges/counterargues*
[Iterate together]
User: [accept when both agree]
```

## IDE Diff Modification Flow

### How It Works

When the main conversation proposes file changes, you see diffs in your IDE. You can:

1. **Modify the proposed changes directly** - Edit the diff before accepting
2. **Add QUESTION: comments** - Insert inline questions about the proposal
3. **Accept, reject, or iterate** - Standard diff workflow

### Main Conversation Responsibilities

**For Decision Points - Use AskUserQuestion Tool:**

When main conversation needs user decision on implementation choices:

1. **ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion tool** - Don't propose options in conversation text
2. **Present 2-4 clear options** with descriptions of trade-offs
3. **Wait for user selection** - Tool handles the UI interaction
4. **Implement based on user choice** - User picks, you execute

**Example:**
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Proposing in conversation:
"Should we use Option A (faster) or Option B (more maintainable)?"

# ✅ CORRECT - Using tool:
AskUserQuestion(questions=[{
  "question": "Which approach should we use for the checkpoint filter?",
  "header": "Approach",
  "options": [
    {"label": "Inline (Option A)", "description": "Faster but duplicated code"},
    {"label": "Helper (Option B)", "description": "DRY but adds indirection"}
  ]
}])
```

**When user modifies a proposal:**

1. **Acknowledge the modification explicitly**
   - ✅ "I see you changed X to Y. Good call because [rationale]..."
   - ✅ "I notice you adjusted X. That makes sense given [context]..."

2. **Offer counterarguments when warranted** (collaboration, not blind obedience)
   - ✅ "I see you changed X to Y, but consider: Z might be better because [rationale]. What do you think?"
   - ❌ "Okay, I'll use Y." (when you have legitimate concerns)

3. **Iterate until consensus**
   - Discussion continues until both agree
   - No rushing to acceptance

**When user adds QUESTION: comment:**

1. **Answer the question clearly**
   - Explain rationale, provide context
   - Reference relevant architectural decisions or patterns

2. **Remove the QUESTION: comment from code**
   - Propose cleaned version without comment
   - User can then accept or ask follow-up questions

3. **Example:**
   ```rust
   // User adds in diff:
   pub fn process(data: String) -> Result<Output, Error> {
       // QUESTION: Why Result instead of Option here?
       // ... rest of code
   }

   // Main conversation responds:
   "Good question! Using Result here because we need to distinguish between
   different failure modes (ParseError vs ValidationError), not just
   presence/absence. Option would lose that error context. Here's the
   cleaned version..."

   // Then proposes:
   pub fn process(data: String) -> Result<Output, Error> {
       // ... rest of code (no QUESTION: comment)
   }
   ```

### Acknowledgment Examples

**User changed implementation approach:**
```
Main: "I see you switched from Vec to HashMap for storage. Smart—that
gives us O(1) lookups instead of O(n). Continuing with HashMap approach..."
```

**User changed with potential issue:**
```
Main: "I notice you changed the error type from Result to Option. That
works, but we'll lose the ability to distinguish between parse failures
and validation failures. Should we keep Result to preserve error context,
or is Option sufficient for this use case?"
```

**User made obvious improvement:**
```
Main: "Nice—you simplified the pattern matching. Much clearer. Building
on that approach..."
```

## Agent Permissions and Categories

### Advisory Agents (NO File Edit Permissions)

**Purpose:** Research, analyze, recommend—but never create finished artifacts

**Characteristics:**
- NO Write/Edit/NotebookEdit tool access
- CAN use Read, Glob, Grep, WebSearch, WebFetch
- CAN use memento tools to store findings
- MUST return recommendations to main conversation
- Main conversation facilitates user collaboration on implementation

**Examples:**
- research-specialist
- TDD agents (red-tdd-tester, green-implementer)
- Domain modeling agents (rust/python/typescript/elixir-domain-model-expert)
- Planning agents (requirements-analyst, story-planner, adr-writer, story-architect, ux-consultant)
- Event modeling agents (all 13 step agents)
- acceptance-validator

**Flow:**
1. Main conversation calls advisory agent
2. Agent researches/analyzes
3. Agent stores findings in memento
4. Agent returns recommendations with rationale
5. Main conversation presents to user
6. Main and user collaborate on implementation
7. Main conversation (or file-editor for direct user requests) makes actual edits

### Autonomous Agents (CAN Edit Files - Purely Mechanical)

**Purpose:** Mechanical operations with no creative decisions

**Characteristics:**
- CAN use Write/Edit/NotebookEdit for mechanical fixes
- NO creative or design decisions
- Execute well-defined mechanical transformations

**Examples:**
- technical-documentation-writer (formatting/consistency only, not content creation)
- devops (infrastructure configuration following established patterns)
- file-editor (ONLY for explicit user requests like "fix this typo")

**Constraints:**
- No design decisions
- No architectural choices
- No content creation
- Only formatting, consistency, or explicit user-directed edits

### Skills (Execute in Main Conversation)

**Purpose:** Repeated operations available as conversational capabilities

**Characteristics:**
- Execute within main conversation (context preserved)
- Permissions vary by skill purpose
- Feel like native capabilities
- User invokes directly or automatically triggered

**Examples:**
- git-operations (can stage/commit)
- codebase-explorer (read-only)
- knowledge-graph (memento operations)
- trace-analysis (read-only analysis)
- mutation-testing (runs tests)
- dependency-management (can modify deps)

## Phase-Specific Collaboration

### Requirements Phase

**NOT:** Agent writes REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS.md → user approves

**YES:**
```
Main: "Let's explore what you need. What problem are we solving?"
User: [discusses problem]
Main: "Based on that, here are the requirements I'm seeing... [proposes]"
User: [modifies in IDE, adds QUESTION: comments]
Main: [responds to questions, acknowledges changes]
[Iterate together]
Together: Create REQUIREMENTS_ANALYSIS.md
```

### Event Modeling Phase

**NOT:** Agent creates complete event model → user approves

**YES:**
```
Main: *may call event-modeling advisory agents for structure/research*
Agents: *return recommendations on event sequences, patterns*
Main: "Based on analysis, the workflow could be modeled as... [proposes]"
User: [refines events, adds questions about commands/projections]
Main: [responds, iterates on design]
Together: Build event model collaboratively
```

### Architecture Phase (ADRs)

**NOT:** Agent writes ADRs → user approves

**YES:**
```
Main: "For this requirement, we could use approach A or B..."
User: "What about approach C?"
Main: *may call research agent to investigate approach C*
Agent: *returns findings on C with tradeoffs*
Main: "Research shows C has these benefits/drawbacks... [proposes ADR]"
User: [modifies ADR in IDE, adds questions]
Main: [responds, refines]
Together: Document architectural decision
```

### Story Planning Phase

**NOT:** Agent creates all stories → user approves backlog

**YES:**
```
Main: "Let's break requirements into deliverable stories..."
User: "Start with the authentication flow"
Main: "For auth, I'm thinking these stories... [proposes]"
User: [adjusts priorities, refines acceptance criteria, adds questions]
Main: [responds to questions, incorporates feedback]
Together: Build prioritized backlog
```

### TDD/Implementation Phase

**NOT:** TDD agent writes test → commits → green agent implements → commits

**YES:**
```
Main: *calls red-tdd-tester for analysis*
Agent: *analyzes story, recommends test approach*
Main: "Agent suggests testing X with approach Y. Here's the test... [proposes]"
User: [modifies test in IDE, adds QUESTION: about assertions]
Main: [answers question, refines test]
Together: Finalize test

Main: *runs test, sees failure*
Main: *calls domain-model-expert for type analysis if needed*
Agent: *recommends type-safe approach*
Main: "To make this pass, we could implement Z... [proposes]"
User: [refines implementation, asks about edge cases]
Main: [addresses questions, adjusts implementation]
Together: Make test pass
```

## When Agents CAN Edit Files

**The ONLY scenarios where agents can directly edit files:**

### 1. Purely Mechanical Work (Autonomous Agents)
- Formatting fixes with no decisions (markdownlint, rustfmt results)
- Consistency corrections following established patterns
- No creative or architectural choices involved

### 2. Explicit User Requests (file-editor agent)
- User says: "Fix the typo in line 42 of main.rs"
- User says: "Remove the unused import in auth.rs"
- Direct, specific file modifications with no decisions

### 3. Infrastructure/Config (devops agent)
- Following established patterns for deployment configs
- No architectural decisions, just configuration data

**In ALL other cases:** Agent recommends → main conversation collaborates with user → main conversation or file-editor makes edits

## Collaboration Quality Checks

Before proposing any code/documentation change:

- [ ] Have advisory agents been consulted for research if needed?
- [ ] Is the proposal based on user input and preferences?
- [ ] Will user be able to modify the proposal in IDE?
- [ ] Am I prepared to acknowledge user modifications?
- [ ] Am I prepared to counterargue if I have concerns?
- [ ] Can I explain rationale for design choices?
- [ ] Have I identified where QUESTION: comments might arise?

After user modifies proposal:

- [ ] Did I acknowledge what they changed?
- [ ] Did I explain why I agree or offer thoughtful counterargument?
- [ ] Did I answer any QUESTION: comments?
- [ ] Did I remove QUESTION: comments from cleaned proposal?
- [ ] Are we iterating toward consensus?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Rubber-Stamp Approval
```
Agent: *returns complete implementation*
Main: "Agent completed the work. Does this look good?"
User: [approve/reject]
```

**Why wrong:** User never participated in design decisions

### ❌ Blind Obedience
```
User: *changes X to Y*
Main: "Okay, using Y."
```

**Why wrong:** No critical thinking, missed opportunity to discuss tradeoffs

### ❌ Ignoring User Modifications
```
User: *modifies proposal in IDE*
Main: *proposes next change without acknowledging previous modification*
```

**Why wrong:** User feels ignored, loses sense of collaboration

### ❌ Agent Creates Finished Artifacts
```
Event modeling agent: *creates complete EVENT_MODEL.md*
Main: "Review this event model"
```

**Why wrong:** User didn't participate in design, can only approve/reject

### ❌ Silent QUESTION: Comment Removal
```
User: // QUESTION: Why this approach?
Main: *proposes cleaned code without answering question*
```

**Why wrong:** User's question ignored, no learning or collaboration

## Best Practices

### ✅ Proactive Explanation
```
Main: "I'm proposing we use a HashMap here instead of Vec because we need
O(1) lookups for user IDs. The tradeoff is higher memory usage, but given
our expected user count (< 10k), that's acceptable. What do you think?"
```

### ✅ Thoughtful Counterargument
```
User: *changes to simpler error handling*
Main: "I see you simplified to Option. That works for happy paths, but
we'll lose visibility into why parsing failed. For debugging, Result<T, ParseError>
might be better. However, if you prefer simplicity here, we can add detailed
logging instead. Which direction feels right?"
```

### ✅ Building on User Changes
```
User: *restructures module organization*
Main: "Nice—you've separated concerns more clearly with the new module structure.
That makes the dependency graph cleaner. Let me adjust the imports to match..."
```

### ✅ Answering QUESTION: Comments Thoroughly
```
User: // QUESTION: Why Arc<Mutex<T>> instead of RefCell?
Main: "Great question! We need Arc<Mutex<T>> here because we're sharing this
state across threads. RefCell is single-threaded only—it would panic at runtime
if accessed from multiple threads. Since our server uses tokio's multithreaded
runtime, Arc<Mutex<T>> gives us thread-safe interior mutability. Here's the
cleaned version..."
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

This collaboration model integrates with existing processes:

- **TDD_WORKFLOW.md:** Red and Green phases become collaborative
- **DOMAIN_MODELING.md:** Type design happens collaboratively
- **EVENT_MODELING.md:** Each step involves user participation
- **DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md:** Dependency decisions discussed, not just executed
- **Git operations:** Commit messages can be refined collaboratively

See specific process files for phase-specific collaboration details (updated per .claude-11).

## Summary

**Key Mindset Shift:**

- **Old:** Agent does work → user approves/rejects
- **New:** Agent researches/recommends → main and user collaborate → together we create

**The user is not a reviewer. The user is a co-creator.**

Every design decision, architectural choice, and implementation approach should involve the user as an active participant. The main conversation facilitates this collaboration using IDE diff modification and QUESTION: comments as the primary interaction mechanisms.
